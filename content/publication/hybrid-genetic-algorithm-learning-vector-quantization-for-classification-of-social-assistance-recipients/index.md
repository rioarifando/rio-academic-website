abstract: "The social assistance program called “Rastra” is a government program
  that aims to ease the burden on poor families by providing food. However, the
  distribution of the food to prospective beneficiaries is still not accurate.
  So, a classification method is needed that can help to estimate the right
  target. In this study, the classification of social assistance recipients by
  using the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) method. LVQ weight vector is very
  important in the classification process because it affects the classification
  results. This study applies the Genetic Algorithm to optimize the LVQ weight
  vector to improve accuracy. The results obtained from this study indicate an
  LVQ accuracy of 84.16% and GA-LVQ gives a higher accuracy of 87.08%. Produces
  the best parameters: population size (popSize) 100, crossover rate (cr) 0.5,
  mutation rate (mr) 0.5, max generation 80, learning rate (a) 0.1 and reduce
  learning rate (dec a) 0, 1. The use of the LVQ method that is optimized using
  GA has been shown to provide better results, with higher accuracy values
  compared to the LVQ method without being optimized."
