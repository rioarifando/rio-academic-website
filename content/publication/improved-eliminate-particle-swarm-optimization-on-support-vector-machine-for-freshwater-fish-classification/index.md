abstract: Freshwater fish is a type of fish for consumption to substitute
  saltwater fish in areas far from the sea. Freshwater fish production is not as
  much as saltwater fish because the selection of freshwater fish is not
  suitable in the cultivation process. Therefore, a classification method to
  determine the type of freshwater fish that is good for aquaculture is
  proposed, one of the classification methods that can be used is the Support
  Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is used to process the classification of freshwater
  fish that have the potential to be cultivated. SVM has weaknesses in the
  classification process, so SVM requires an optimization method that can
  overcome it's weaknesses, one optimization method that can be used is Improved
  Eliminate Particle Swarm Optimization (IEPSO). IEPSO is used to optimize
  features and parameters in the SVM method. The data used in the research came
  from the Fish and Livestock Breeding Center of Nganjuk Regency with a
  percentage of 90% of training data and 10% of test data. The results of the
  study using SVM-IEPSO using feature selection and parameter optimization
  obtained 88% accuracy in the classification process to determine the type of
  freshwater fish. The classification results will be more optimal if there are
  more types of freshwater fish species used in the training process, because
  this study only uses data on freshwater fish species that are only found in
  Livestock Breeding Center of Nganjuk Regency.
