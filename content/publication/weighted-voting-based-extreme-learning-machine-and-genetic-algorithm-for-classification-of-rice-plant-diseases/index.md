  Rice plant disease is one of the factors that cause productivity and quality
  of rice decreases and can cause crop failure. Intelligent systems can be used
  to classify diseases rice plants and make a decision based on the method used,
  so that it can assist farmers in identifying disease. One method that can be
  used to solve

  classification problem is Voting Based Extreme Learning Machine (VELM). The VELM method adapts the concept of ensemble learning by combining ELM classifier as much as K. To determine the effect of each classifier In this case, the VELM method is combined with the weighting technique majority vote. However, in determining the weight will be difficult because must determine the proper weight for each classifier. In this research, optimization using Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to optimize weighted majority voting on VELM.
