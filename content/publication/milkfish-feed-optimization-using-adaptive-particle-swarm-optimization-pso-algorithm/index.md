abstract: Milkfish is a cultivation commodity that contributes quite
  significantly on a national scale. But in practice, milkfish cultivation
  requires a large number of production costs, especially in the provision of
  fish feed. This research will discuss how to optimize the composition of
  milkfish feed, minimize costs without lowering production yields, and still
  pay attention to the nutritional needs of milkfish cultivation. The
  optimization method, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is applied to the
  formulation process and the composition of milkfish feed to meet the
  nutritional needs of fish with minimal cost. Improvements to the PSO resulted
  in Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO). This improvement conducted to
  strengthen PSO's ability to explore broad areas of search for solutions
  efficiently. The results of computational analysis prove that APSO produces a
  better solution than PSO.
