abstract: Patchouli has various varieties with almost the same physical
  characteristics. This often makes it difficult to recognize varieties with a
  high PA (Patchouli Alcohol) content. In this study an improvisation was
  introduced in the identification of patchouli varieties using leaf images
  using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). However, problems occur in ELM if the
  data used is not balanced where the training process can not able to recognize
  data in the minority class well. Therefore, this study conducted a process to
  balance the composition of the data using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
  Technique (SMOTE) method. The test results of 93 data on the imbalanced
  composition with a comparison of 70% of training data and 30% of test data
  obtained an average accuracy of 93.57%. After implementing SMOTE in the
  Tetraploid, Patchoulina and Sidikalang classes where the amount of data in
  each class becomes 58 data, an average accuracy of 96.00% is achieved. This
  shows the existence of an increase in the process of identification with ELM
  when new data generation with SMOTE is carried out to balance the composition
  of the data.
